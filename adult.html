                    <h2 class="topic">CHRONIC BACK PAIN</h2>
                    <p class="fst-italic">The most common causes include: Arthritis of the spine —the gradual thinning of the cartilage inside the spine. Spinal stenosis —narrowing of the spinal canal that may lead to nerve pain. Disc problems, such as a herniated or bulging disc.
                        Herbal oils, massages, and specific therapies like Panchakarma are utilized to manage chronic back pain.

                        <h3>Solutions-</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><i class="bi bi-check-circle"></i>Herbal Oil Massage (Abhyanga): Warm some Ayurvedic herbal oils like sesame oil, coconut oil, or Mahanarayan oil and gently massage your back. This helps improve blood circulation and reduces muscle stiffness.
                            </li>
                            <li><i class="bi bi-check-circle"></i>Ginger and Turmeric Tea: Boil fresh ginger and turmeric in water to make a tea. Both ginger and turmeric have anti-inflammatory properties that can help alleviate pain and reduce inflammation.
                                </li>
                            <li><i class="bi bi-check-circle"></i>Herbal Compress (Potali Sweda): Prepare a compress by filling a cloth pouch with a mixture of dried herbs like ginger, garlic, turmeric, and rock salt. Heat the pouch and gently massage the affected area with it.
                            
                            </li>
                            <li><i class="bi bi-check-circle"></i>Epsom Salt Bath: Soaking in a warm bath with Epsom salt can help relax muscles and alleviate back pain. Epsom salt contains magnesium, which can be absorbed through the skin and assist in muscle relaxation.
                            </li>
                            <li><i class="bi bi-check-circle"></i>Yoga and Stretching: Practice gentle yoga poses and stretching exercises specifically designed to relieve back pain. Poses like Cat-Cow, Child's Pose, Cobra Pose, and Pavanamuktasana (Wind-Relieving Pose) may provide relief.
                            </li>
                            <li><i class="bi bi-check-circle"></i>Herbal Supplements: Ayurvedic herbs like Ashwagandha, Shallaki (Boswellia), Guggulu, and Triphala may be beneficial in managing chronic back pain. However, it's crucial to consult an Ayurvedic practitioner or healthcare provider for the appropriate dosage and suitability for your condition.
                            </li>
                            <li><i class="bi bi-check-circle"></i>Proper Posture and Ergonomics: Maintain good posture while sitting, standing, and sleeping. Use ergonomic chairs and mattresses that support your back properly.
